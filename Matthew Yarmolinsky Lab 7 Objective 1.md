# Description of Target Objective:
The target objective is to make and execute a script which edits an image like I did in lab 5.  The makefile does the following:
- defines a script
- exports the script
- echoes the script to myscript.sh
- compiles the script
- executes the script
- deletes the script with `make clean`
